## General

<p>Research project being developed for the University of São Paulo, in Brazil, aiming to classify correctly the quality label of a eye-fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks. This project is focusing on using the brazilian dataset BRSet, made by the Federal University of São Paulo, putting Brazil on the spot for Ophthalmology research.</p>

<p>This project was first proposed at University of São Paulo medical school (FMUSP), in which the final goal is to detect possible causes for Cognitive Decline, and Diabetes is one of the research scopes. On top of that, Computer Science students at IME-USP are being responsible for developing a deep learning algorithm capable of recognizing eye diseases, including Diabetic Retinopathy, really common on people with diabetes, and this classification should be held into account on the Cognitive Decline research. To optimize the results on the eye diseases classification problem, it is really important to assess the quality of the images used, to guarantee that the Machine Learning model can actually find the diseases with no problem.</p>

<p>The quality classification is made based on the following metrics:</p>

> Focus: is the focus good enough to perform proper classification on smaller retinal injuries?
>
> Illumination: is the image illumination adequate? (Not too dark, not too bright)
>
> Image Field: does the image field includes all of the optic nerve head and macula?
>
> Artifacts: is the image free of artifacts, such as dust, arch deffects, eyelashes images, lens reflex etc.?
